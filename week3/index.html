            McLuhan’s central argument—that societies are shaped more by the <strong>medium</strong> of communication
            than by its content—highlights how deeply technology influences perception and restructures daily life.
            The internet, in particular, feels less like a tool and more like an <strong>extension of the self</strong>,
            blurring the boundaries between individual and collective experience.

            What stood out to me most is his idea of collapsing private spheres: the distinction between the public
            and the personal has eroded, replaced by a constantly connected “<strong>global village</strong>.”
            In this environment, everyone is both audience and performer, and intimacy becomes something that happens on display.

        <p> "All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, 
            moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered."</p>
