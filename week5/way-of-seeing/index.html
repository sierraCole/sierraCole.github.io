      <div class="reflection">
        From John Berger's Ways of Seeing, episode 2 stuck out to me the most. In his discussion of 
        the nude as an art form, I really loved the overall connection to the experience of woman/young 
        girls in society. He discusses the difference between nudity and nakedness; 
        nakedness as being oneself, and nudity as being seen naked by others, yet not wholly seen as a person. Women were often painted, and now photographed, 
        nude, simply being seen as objects of desire rather than people. Then, these women and girls are blamed for their desirability under the gaze of the same
        men who've depicted them as sexual objects.
